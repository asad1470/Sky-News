            <p class="para">On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II.[12][13][14] It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. From a population of 41 million in January 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.</p>

                In 2013, Ukraine's parliament overwhelmingly approved finalizing an association agreement with the European Union (EU).[25] Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.[26] Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders.[27] In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement,[28] choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014. Yanukovych was removed from power by parliament and fled to Russia.Since 23 February 2014 Pro-Russian unrest followed in eastern and southern Ukraine. Russian soldiers with no insignia occupied the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament.[29] Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, after a widely disputed referendum.

                On 21 February, Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as "peacekeepers",[66] and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.[67]Before 5 a.m. Kyiv time on 24 February, Putin in another speech announced, a "special military operation", which "effectively declar[ed] war on Ukraine."[68][69] Putin said the operation was to "protect the people" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He falsely claimed that they had "been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime."[70] Putin also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[71] He said Russia sought the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine, and espoused views challenging Ukraine's right to exist.[72][73] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[71] Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[74] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.[75] Russia did not officially declare war.[76] Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[77]

                On 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi.[237] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a "Mighty Putin". Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.[238] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and minister of defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called.[239] He also said that his country would use "all means" to "defend itself." Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable, and was an attempt to justify "Russia's failures."[240] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an "escalation",[241] while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as "cannon fodder."[242]On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.[244] Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.[245]

                Official and estimated numbers of prisoners of war (POW) have varied.[479] On 24 February Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of 74th Guards from Kemerovo Oblast had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.[480] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,[481] while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.[482] It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol.[483]On 24 March 2022, 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russians and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.[484] On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged[485] for an unknown number of Russian troops.[486] The Independent on 9 June 2022 cited an intelligence estimate of more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers captured, while the Russian servicemen held prisoner fell from 900 in April to 550 after several prisoner exchanges.Violations of human rights and atrocity crimes have both occurred during the war. From 2014 to 2021, there were more than 3,000 civilian casualties, with most occurring in 2014 and 2015.[281] The right of movement was impeded for the inhabitants of the conflict zone.[282] Arbitrary detention was practiced by both sides in the first years of the conflict. It decreased after 2016 in government-held areas, while in the separatist-held ones it continued.[283] Investigations into the abuses committed by both sides made little progress.[284][285]

                No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. When Putin announced the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, he claimed to commence a "special military operation", side-stepping a formal declaration of war.[41] The statement was, however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government[42] and reported as such by many international news sources.[43][44] While the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a "terrorist state" in regard to its military actions in Ukraine,[45] it has not issued a formal declaration of war on its behalf.
                The Russian invasion of Ukraine violated international law (including the Charter of the United Nations).[53][54][55][56] The invasion has also been called a crime of aggression under international criminal law[57] and under some countries' domestic criminal codes – including those of Ukraine and Russia – although procedural obstacles exist to prosecutions under these laws.[58][59]The Russo-Ukrainian War[c] is an ongoing international conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which began in February 2014.[d] Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country.

                In his speech justifying the invasion of Ukraine, Putin falsely claimed that NATO military infrastructure was being built up inside Ukraine and was a threat to Russia.[373] Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov characterized the conflict as a proxy war started by NATO.[374] He said: "We don't think we're at war with NATO ... Unfortunately, NATO believes it is at war with Russia".[375] NATO says it is not at war with Russia; its official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, but rather its members support Ukraine in "its right to self-defense, as enshrined in the UN Charter".[376] NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.[376] Former CIA director Leon Panetta told the ABC that the U.S. is 'without question' involved in a proxy war with Russia.[377]

                Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic and Black Seas often do not indicate their position or communicate with air traffic controllers, thus posing a potential risk to civilian airliners. NATO aircraft scrambled many times to track and intercept these aircraft near alliance airspace. The Russian aircraft intercepted never entered NATO airspace, and the interceptions were conducted in a safe and routine manner.[378]
